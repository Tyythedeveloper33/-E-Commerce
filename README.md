## Description
Welcome to the E-Commerce Back End project! In this application, we have built a robust back end for an e-commerce website using the latest technologies. This project showcases the fundamental architecture required for an e-commerce platform, enabling businesses to compete effectively in the online retail industry.
## User Story
As a manager at an internet retail company, I wanted a powerful back end solution for my e-commerce website. With this application, my company can now compete confidently with other e-commerce giants, providing seamless services to our customers.
## Acceptance Criteria
This project fulfills the following acceptance criteria:

Connects to a MySQL database using the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages.
Secures sensitive data like MySQL username, password, and database name using environment variables through the dotenv package.
Syncs Sequelize models to a MySQL database on server start.
Includes proper column definitions and model associations as per the Challenge instructions.
Provides a unique repository name, adhering to best practices for file structure, naming conventions, and code quality.
Features multiple descriptive commit messages for better understanding of development progress.
Offers a comprehensive readme file containing project description, video walkthrough, and grading criteria.
## Mock-Up

## Getting Started
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Install the required npm packages using `npm install`.
Create your database using the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder.
Set up environment variables for sensitive data in the `.env` file.
Run the application using `npm start`.
## Database Models
The application includes the following four models, each adhering to specific requirements:

`Category`: Represents product categories.
`Product`: Represents products available for sale.
`Tag`: Represents tags associated with products.
`ProductTag`: Represents the relationship between products and tags.
## Associations
The Sequelize models have the following associations:

`Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models.
`Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models.
## API Routes
The application features RESTful CRUD operations with the following API routes:

`GET` routes for all categories, products, and tags.
`GET` routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag.
`POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes for categories, products, and tags.
## Seed Data
Seed your database with initial data by running `npm run seed`. This will provide test data for testing your routes.
## Syncing Models
Sequelize models are automatically synced to the MySQL database on server start. This ensures your database is up to date with the latest changes.
## Video Walkthrough
For a detailed demonstration of the application's functionality, please watch the [Walkthrough Video](#) which showcases the creation of the schema, seeding the database, starting the server, testing API routes, and fulfilling all the acceptance criteria.
